// There is a single operator in JavaScript, capable of providing the remainder of a division operation. Two numbers are passed as parameters. The first parameter divided by the second parameter will have a remainder, possibly zero. Return that value.

}





remainder(1, 3) // ➞ 1

remainder(3, 4) // ➞ 3

remainder(-9, 45) // ➞ -9

remainder(5, 5) // ➞ 0
